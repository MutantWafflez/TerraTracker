Currently in ALPHA.

Ever wanted to know how much damage you've dealt over your player's career? Or maybe how many times you've jumped, dashed, or dodged? Well this is the mod for you!

This mod tracks several different statistics for each player, with more to be added as the mod gets updated.

Opening the statistic menu defaults to the "O" key. Can be changed in the controls menu.

Note: This mod MUST be enabled in order to ensure up-to-date statistics. Vanilla doesn't track these statistics on its own, so this mod has to do it. Your stats will NOT update or be tracked without this mod enabled!
