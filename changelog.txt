ALPHA RELEASE 0.1.2.3 [A Rewritten Delight] (September 14th, 2025)
Changes:
* Rewrote a lot of internal code to fix a nasty bit of technical debt that caused stats to persist across different players
	-> To be more precise, if you had multiple players on the selection screen, they would have their stats be overwritten by whatever player was last in the list
